So to launch eight copies, each pinned to cores 0â€“7, your batch file (run_all.bat) could look like:

bat

Copy

@echo off

:: assuming main.exe is in the same folder as this .bat

cd /d "%~dp0"


start "" /affinity 0x1  "%~dp0main.exe" -1

start "" /affinity 0x2  "%~dp0main.exe" -2

start "" /affinity 0x4  "%~dp0main.exe" -3

start "" /affinity 0x8  "%~dp0main.exe" -4

start "" /affinity 0x10 "%~dp0main.exe" -5

start "" /affinity 0x20 "%~dp0main.exe" -6

start "" /affinity 0x40 "%~dp0main.exe" -7

start "" /affinity 0x80 "%~dp0main.exe" -8

echo Launched 8 instances, each on its own core.
